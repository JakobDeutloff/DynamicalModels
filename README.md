# DynamicalModels
Hello new recruit, glad you made it that far. 
This repository contains the three simple dynamical models I referred to in my educational video on modelling of dynamical systems. 
You also find a directory called plots whis, obviously, contains the plots used in my film.
Please feel free to clone the repository and give it a try. 
In case you are not familiar with github you can also just download the repository as a zip file by clicking on Code and Download Zip.
